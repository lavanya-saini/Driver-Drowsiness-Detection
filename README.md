# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
## Overview
This repository houses the codebase and resources for an Enhanced Driver Safety System driven by deep learning technologies. Our focus is on real-time detection of driver drowsiness, unease, or sleepiness using in-car cameras, coupled with proactive safety measures to mitigate potential risks.
## Features
+ ### Drowsiness Detection:
Utilizes a deep learning algorithm to analyze facial expressions and eye movements for early detection of driver drowsiness.
+ ### Real-time Alerts:
Issues immediate alerts to the driver upon detecting signs of drowsiness, ensuring prompt attention.
+ ### Rest Stop Recommendations:
Provides recommendations for nearby rest stops or hotels, encouraging the driver to take breaks and rest when needed.
+ ### Gradual Speed Reduction:
Implements a system to gradually reduce the vehicle's speed to a predefined threshold if a sleepy driver is detected, enhancing safety.
## Performance Metrics
+ ### Accuracy: 
Evaluate the accuracy of the model on test data to ensure reliable predictions.
+ ### False Positive Rate: 
Monitor false positive rates to minimize unnecessary alerts and interventions.
+ ### Response Time: 
Assess the system's responsiveness in issuing alerts and recommendations.
