# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an Enhanced Driver Safety System leveraging deep learning. The project focuses on real-time detection of driver drowsiness, unease, or sleepiness using in-car cameras and provides proactive safety measures to mitigate potential risks.
## Features
### + Drowsiness Detection:
Utilizes a deep learning algorithm to analyze facial expressions and eye movements for early detection of driver drowsiness.
### + Real-time Alerts:
Issues immediate alerts to the driver upon detecting signs of drowsiness, ensuring prompt attention.
### + Rest Stop Recommendations:
Provides recommendations for nearby rest stops or hotels, encouraging the driver to take breaks and rest when needed.
### + Gradual Speed Reduction:
Implements a system to gradually reduce the vehicle's speed to a predefined threshold if a sleepy driver is detected, enhancing safety.
