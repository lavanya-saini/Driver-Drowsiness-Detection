# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Our project aims to revolutionize driver safety by implementing a state-of-the-art Deep Learning model designed to detect signs of driver drowsiness, unease, or sleepiness in real-time. Leveraging computer vision technology, the system analyzes data from in-car cameras to monitor facial features and eye movements.
